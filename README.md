Code samples used for my Digital Politics course

I teach a course called Digital Politics. In the course, we explore a number of topics, including accessibility, algorithms, and social media. To help students better understand some of the issues and do some beginner-level analysis, we explore some actual markup and code. The documents housed here are some of the examples that we explore.
